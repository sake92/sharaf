[{"text":"Query Parameters How to bind query parameter as an enum? Sharaf needs a QueryStringRW[T] instance for query params. It can automatically derive an instance for singleton enums: enum Cloud derives QueryStringRW:\n  case aws, gcp, azure\n\ncase class MyQueryParams(\n  cloud: Cloud\n) derives QueryStringRW\n How to bind optional query parameter? The first option is to set the parameter to Option[T]: case class MyQP(mandatory: String, opt: Option[Int]) derives QueryStringRW\n If you make a request with params ?mandatory=abc, opt will have value of None. The second option is to set the parameter to some default value: case class MyQP2(mandatory: String, opt: Int = 42) derives QueryStringRW\n Here if you make a request with params ?mandatory=abc the opt will have value of 42. Note that you need the -Yretain-trees scalac flag turned on, otherwise it won't work! How to bind sequence query parameter? Set the parameter to Seq[T]: case class MyQP(seq: Seq[Int]) derives QueryStringRW\n Let's consider a few possible requests with these query params: ? (empty) -> seq will be empty Seq() ?seq=123 -> seq will be Seq(123) ?seq[]=123&seq[]=456 -> seq will be Seq(123, 456) ?seq[1]=123&seq[0]=456 -> seq will be Seq(456, 123) (note it is sorted here) How to bind composite query parameter? You can make a common query params class and use it in multiple top-level query params, or standalone: case class PageQP(page: Int, size: Int) derives QueryStringRW\ncase class MyQP(q: String, p: PageQP) derives QueryStringRW\n Sharaf is quite lenient when parsing the query parameters, so all these combinations will work: ?q=abc&p.page=0&p.size=10 -> object style ?q=abc&p[page]=0&p[size]=10 -> brackets style ?q=abc&p[page]=0&p.size=10 -> mixed style (dont) How to bind a custom query parameter? When you want to handle a custom scalar value in query params, you need to implement a QueryStringRW[T] instance manually: import ba.sake.querson.*\n\ngiven QueryStringRW[MyType] with {\n  override def write(path: String, value: MyType): QueryStringData =\n    QueryStringRW[String].write(path, value.toString)\n\n  override def parse(path: String, qsData: QueryStringData): MyType =\n    val str = QueryStringRW[String].parse(path, qsData)\n    Try(MyType.fromString(str)).toOption.getOrElse(typeError(path, \"MyType\", str))\n}\n\nprivate def typeError(path: String, tpe: String, value: Any): Nothing =\n  throw ParsingException(ParseError(path, s\"invalid \\$tpe\", Some(value)))\n Then you can use it: case class MyQueryParams(\n  myType: MyType\n) derives QueryStringRW\n Note that Sharaf can automatically derive an instance for singleton enums.","title":"Query Parameters","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/howtos/query-params.html"},{"text":"Redirect Use the Response.redirect function: case GET -> Path(\"a-deprecated-route\") =>\n    Response.redirect(\"/this-other-place\")\n This will redirect the request to \"/this-other-place\", with status 301 MOVED_PERMANENTLY","title":"Redirect","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/howtos/redirect.html"},{"text":"Exception Handler How to customize the Exception handler?

Async frameworks like Play, Akka HTTP etc Synchronous programming is much, much easier to understand, debug, profile etc.. Benefits (performance/throughput) of async handling are mostly void in Java 21, with introduction of Virtual threads. Yay! Only bummer for now is that Undertow doesn't still support them.. :/ But undertow is very performant in the current shape too, so for most use cases it will be enough. Java 24 is a game changer for Undertow, because it solves the problem of Synchronize Virtual Threads without Pinning. Pure FP libs like http4s, zio-http etc Too much focus on purely functional programming and (mostly unnecessary) math concepts. Easy to get lost in that and overcomplicate your code. Enterprise frameworks like Spring Framework, Quarkus etc Too much annotations, autoconfigurations, dependency injection, proxies and complexity. Standalone JEE servers like Tomcat, Jetty etc I was looking into these, but then sharaf would have to depend on Servlets API, use @Inject and gazzilion of god-knows-what-they-do annotations just to configure OAuth2 for example...","title":"Alternatives","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/philosophy/alternatives.html"},{"text":"Query Params Handling Query params handling design Web frameworks do handle query params with various mechanisms: annotation + method param: Spring and most other popular Java frameworks, Cask etc special route file DSL: PlayFramework, Ruby on Rails in-language DSL: zio-http pattern matching: http4s parsing from request: Sharaf Why not annotations? This approach is mostly fine, as long as you know from where a parameter comes. In Spring you use the @RequestParam annotation when you have simple parameters. But when you want to group them in a class you don't use it.. #wtf Also, that same class can be bound from the form body too... convenient? eh. In Cask there is no annotation, so it is ambiguous in my opinion. Why not special route file? You need a special compiler for this, essentially a new language. People have to learn how it works, there's probably no syntax highlighting, no autocomplete etc. Why not in-language DSL? Similar to special route file approach, people need to learn it. Not a huge deal I guess. Why not pattern matching? If you look at http4s' approach, you can see that if the query param is not found, it falls through. It is customizable, but more work for you. eh. Essentially you'll get a 404.. which is not a good choice IMO. Rarely any framework does this, and you rarely want to handle the same path in 2 places. Sharaf's approach Sharaf parses query params from the Request. Admittedly, you do have to make a new class if you want to parse them in a typesafe way. But you usually do grouping of these parameters when passing them further, so why not do it immediatelly. Composition adds even more benefits, which I rarely saw implemented in any framework.","title":"Query Params Handling","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/philosophy/query-params-handling.html"},{"text":"Authentication Some important security principles from OWASP guidelines: use HTTPS use random user ids to prevent enumeration and other attacks use strong passwords, store them hashed, implement password recovery use MFA, CAPTCHA, rate limiting etc to prevent automated attacks etc. Read all of them in the OWASP auth cheat sheet. Pac4j Authentication in Sharaf is done usually by delegating it to pac4j. Pac4j is a battle-tested and widely used library for authentication and authorization. It supports many authentication mechanisms, including: form based authentication (username + password) OAuth2, with many providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc) Pac4j has a concept of Client, which is a type of authentication mechanism. The main split is between IndirectClient and DirectClient. Indirect clients Indirect clients are used for form based authentication, OAuth2, etc. An important thing to mention here is the callback URL: for username + password authentication, the callback URL where the form is submitted to. Then a server-side session is created and user is signed in. for OAuth2 (and similar mechanisms), the callback URL where the user is redirected to after authentication. The server will then exchange the code for an access token and create a server-side session. Direct clients Direct clients are used for API authentication on every request (e.g. Basic Auth, JWT, etc). On every request, the client will extract the credentials from the request and authenticate the user. Deny by Default Principle One important principle in security is the \"deny by default\" principle. You should use whitelisting, allow access only to what is needed. This is because it is easy to forget to deny something, and it is hard to remember everything that should be denied. Concretely in pac4j, you can use PathMatcher(), to exclude certain paths from authentication: val publicRoutesMatcher = PathMatcher()\npublicRoutesMatcher.excludePaths(\"/\", \"/login-form\")\npac4jConfig.addMatcher(\"publicRoutesMatcher\", publicRoutesMatcher)\n..\nSecurityHandler.build(\n    SharafHandler(..),\n    pac4jConfig,\n    \"client1,client2...\",\n    null,\n    \"securityheaders,publicRoutesMatcher\", // use publicRoutesMatcher here!\n    DefaultSecurityLogic()\n)\n There are also: excludeBranch(\"/somepath\") to exclude all paths starting with \"/somepath\" excludeRegex(\"^/somepath/.*\\$\") to exclude all paths matching the regex (be careful with this one!)","title":"Authentication","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/philosophy/authentication.html"},{"text":"Dependency Injection Do you even Dependency Injection?? Not in a classical / \"dependency container\" / Spring / JEE style. Not in a purely-functional-monadic style. Yes in a direct style: for singletons: just instantiate a class and pass the object around. for request/session-scoped instances: use scala 3 context functions (implicit functions). If you ever used PlayFramework, Slick 2 and similar, you might have used this pattern: someFunction { implicit ctx =>\n    // some code that needs an implicit Ctx\n}\n In Scala 3 there is a new concept called \"context function\" which represents the pattern from above with a type: type ContextualAction = Ctx ?=> Unit\n Now, instead of manually writing implicit ctx we can skip it: someFunction {\n    // some code that needs an implicit Ctx\n}\n and compiler will fill it in for us. The Ctx parameter is implicitly/contextually available (only) in the function body. You can get it with summon[Ctx] or using ctx: Ctx (which is a bit more readable). Sharaf has the Routes type that is defined as Request ?=> PartialFunction[RequestParams, Response[?]]. This means that you can call Request.current only in a Routes definition body (because it requires a given Request to be present). If you need a request-scoped instance (a-la @RequestScoped @Bean in Spring), you need to define a function that is using Request: def currentUser(using req: Request): User =\n    // extract stuff from request\n Same as Request.current, you can only use the currentUser function in a context of a request! By using context functions, you avoid banging your head against the wall while trying to figure out how-the-hell can you inject a request-scoped-thing into a singleton/session-scoped thing... Proxy to proxy to proxy, something, something.. ok. You also avoid reading yet-another-lousy-monad-tutorial, losing your brain-battle agains State, RWS, Kleisli, higher-kinded-types, weird macros, compile times and type inference...","title":"Dependency Injection","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/philosophy/dependency-injection.html"},{"text":"Routes Matching Routes matching design Web frameworks do their routes matching with various mechanisms: annotation + method param: Spring and most other popular Java frameworks, Cask etc special route file DSL: PlayFramework, Ruby on Rails in-language DSL: zio-http, akka-http pattern matching: Sharaf, http4s Why not annotations? Let's see an example: @GetMapping(value = \"/student/{studentId}\")\npublic Student studentData1(@PathVariable Integer studentId) {}\n\n@GetMapping(value = \"/student/{studentId}\")\npublic Student studentData2(@PathVariable Integer studentId) {}\n\n@GetMapping(value = \"/student/umm\")\npublic Student studentData3(@PathVariable Integer studentId) {}\n Issues: the studentId appears in 2 places, you can make a typo and nothing will work. the \"/student/{studentId}\" route is duplicated, there is no compiler support and it will fail only in runtime.. you have to wonder if studentData1 will be picked up before studentData3..!? Why not special route file? Well, you need a special compiler for this, essentially a new language. People have to learn how it works, there's probably no syntax highlighting, no autocomplete etc. Why not in-language DSL? Similar to special route file approach, people need to learn it. And again, you don't leverage compiler's support like exhaustive pattern matching and extractors. Sharaf's approach Sharaf does its route matching in plain scala code. Scala's pattern matching warns you when you have duplicate routes, or impossible routes. For example, if you write this: case GET -> Path(\"cars\", brand) => ???\ncase GET -> Path(\"cars\", model) => ??? // Unreachable case\n\ncase GET -> Path(\"files\", segments*) => ???\ncase GET -> Path(\"files\", \"abc.txt\") => ??? // Unreachable case\n you will get nice warnings, thanks compiler!

This is a Map[String, Seq[String]] which you can use to extract query parameters. The raw approach is useful for simple cases and dynamic query parameters.

In this case you don't even need to define a separate class! Note that you can't use Validation with named tuples Union Types Union Types are also handy sometimes. Say you have a filter functionality, where a user can filter by \"firstName\" or by \"lastName\". You can write: Request.current.queryParams[(firstName: String) | (lastName: String)]. Here we are combining 2 named tuples together with into a union type. You could use any other type of course. You can also write Request.current.queryParams[(id: Int | String)], but we would not recommend it. Of course, if you need it, go for it! In this case, it will first try to parse an Int and if that fails it will parse a String. tuutttt navv","title":"Query Params","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/tutorials/query-params.html"},{"text":"Server Sent Events HTMX is an incredibly simple, HTML-first library.

We also use a var db: Seq[Car] to store our data. (don't do this for real projects) Routes definition Next step is to define a few routes for getting and adding cars: val routes = Routes:  \n  case GET -> Path(\"cars\") =>\n    Response.withBody(CarsDb.findAll())\n\n  case GET -> Path(\"cars\", brand) =>\n    val res = CarsDb.findByBrand(brand)\n    Response.withBody(res)\n\n  case POST -> Path(\"cars\") =>\n    val reqBody = Request.current.bodyJson[Car]\n    CarsDb.add(reqBody)\n    Response.withBody(reqBody)\n The first route returns all data in the database. The second route does some filtering on the database. The third route binds the JSON body from the HTTP request. Then we add it to the database.

In this case you don't even need to define a separate class! Note that you can't use Validation with named tuples Union Types Union Types are also handy sometimes. Say you have a filter functionality, where a user can submit a \"firstName\" or \"lastName\". You can write: Request.current.bodyForm[(firstName: String) | (lastName: String)]. Here we are combining 2 named tuples together with into a union type. You could use any other type of course. You can also write Request.current.bodyForm[(id: Int | String)], but we would not recommend it. Of course, if you need it, go for it! In this case, it will first try to parse an Int and if that fails it will parse a String. tuutttt navv","title":"Forms","url":"https://sake92.github.io/sharaf/tutorials/forms.html"},{"text":"SQL DB setup Create a new Postgres database with Docker: docker run --name sharaf-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres\n Then connect to it via psql (or your favorite SQL tool): docker exec -it sharaf-postgres psql -U postgres postgres\n and create a table: CREATE TABLE customers(\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR\n);\n Squery setup Sharaf recommends the Squery library for accessing databases with a JDBC driver.
